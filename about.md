This is a braindump of my thoughts and ideas, mostly relating to FPGAsm, but sometimes other FPGA tools.  Occasionally, rants and unrelated topics.  I am writing things down to compensate for my chaotic brain.  Don't expect too much.


The code for the FPGAsm project is at
[FPGASM on GitHub](https://github.com/fpgasm)
